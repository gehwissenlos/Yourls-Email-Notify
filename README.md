Caveats

* This plugin is really only useful for sites that have a low volume of clicks and you need to know when the recipients click on them.  Example: say you have an e-commerce site and you need to send links to your customers for quotes or other important information.  This plugin allows you to know when/if your customer clicks on that link so you can take the appropriate action.
* Also, this plugin is highly specialized.  It was written for internal use where we send quotes from a FileMaker db.  Hence the reference to FMP in the code.  However, it should work in any situation.  If you have any suggestions to make this better, please let us know.  However, being that it is highly specialized, the suggestion would need to be beneficial to more than just a subset of people.

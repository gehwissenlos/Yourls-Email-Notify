#### Caveats

* This plugin is really only useful for sites that have a low volume of clicks and you need to know when the recipients click on them.  Example: say you have an e-commerce site and you need to send links to your customers for quotes or other important information.  This plugin allows you to know when/if your customer clicks on that link so you can take the appropriate action.

# Yourls-Email-Notify
Have Yourls send you an email when someone adds a link.

This plugin is very easy to configure.  Simply add the following info to the "Notification Email" admin page:
* To Email Address - this is where you want to receive these notification emails.
* From Email Address - this is the address you want the emails to be sent from.

Plus, if you don't mind digging into the code, you can customize the generated email to your heart's content!

### Installation Instructions

1. Copy everything to your YOURLS_DIRECTORY
2. Activate the plugin
3. Visit the "Notification Email" admin panel to customize your install

#### Thanks

Thanks to [s22-tech](https://github.com/s22-tech/Yourls-Email-Notify) for the plugin. I changed it to send the email when a new short link is added.

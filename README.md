# Yourls-email-notify
Have Yourls send you an email when someone clicks a shortened link.


This is really only useful for sites that have a low volume of clicks and you need to know when the recipient clicks them.  Example: say you have an e-commerce site and you need to send links to your customers for quotes or other important information.  This plugin allows you to know when/if your customer clicks on that link so you can take the appropriate action.
